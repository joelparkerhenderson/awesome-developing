# Raw and cooked

Raw data is original data, such as directly from a source.

Cooked data is raw data after it has been processed - that is, extracted, organized, and perhaps analyzed and presented - for further use.

## Raw literals and cooked literals

A raw literal receives input from the application source and doesnâ€™t interpret it in any way. 

A cooked literal interprets input and performs any required conversions to make the data usable to the recipient.
